    <p>The Assumption Church Service: Monsignor Pruitt leads a full congregation in a powerful mass. Ange's influence
        is at its peak; she encourages public displays of devotion, believing in miraculous salvation through suffering.

        Morgan's Defiance: After Annie's death, Morgan confronts the villagers at the church, gripping the knife she
        found and demanding the relic to bring her back to life. It's chaotic. Parishioners, losing control under Ange's
        sermons, violently tear at Morgan to seize the relic, shouting “They ate her!” Morgan's defiance ends in
        tragedy: she's accidentally killed in the frenzy.
