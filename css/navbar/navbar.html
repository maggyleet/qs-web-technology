            <p>Extraterrestrial life, or alien life (colloquially, aliens), is life that originates from another world
                rather than on Earth. No extraterrestrial life has yet been scientifically conclusively detected. Such
                life might range from simple forms such as prokaryotes to intelligent beings, possibly bringing forth
                civilizations that might be far more, or far less, advanced than humans.[1][2][3] The Drake equation
                speculates about the existence of sapient life elsewhere in the universe. The science of
                extraterrestrial life is known as astrobiology.</p>

            <p>Speculation about the possibility of inhabited worlds beyond Earth dates back to antiquity. Early
                Christian writers discussed the idea of a "plurality of worlds" as proposed by earlier thinkers such as
                Democritus; Augustine references Epicurus's idea of innumerable worlds "throughout the boundless
                immensity of space" in The City of God.</p>

            <p> Pre-modern writers typically assumed extraterrestrial "worlds" were inhabited by living beings. William
                Vorilong, in the 15th century, acknowledged the possibility Jesus could have visited extraterrestrial
                worlds to redeem their inhabitants.Nicholas of Cusa wrote in 1440 that Earth is "a brilliant
                star" like other celestial objects visible in space; which would appear similar to the Sun, from an
                exterior perspective, due to a layer of "fiery brightness" in the outer layer of the atmosphere. He
                theorized all extraterrestrial bodies could be inhabited by men, plants, and animals, including the
                Sun.[5] Descartes wrote that there were no means to prove the stars were not inhabited by "intelligent
                creatures", but their existence was a matter of speculation.</p>
